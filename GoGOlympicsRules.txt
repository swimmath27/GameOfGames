**Slap Cup**
-Setup
Place nineteen cups in the center of the table in a circular formation. Distribute four beers evenly between the 18 outer cups. The nineteenth cup, which rests in the center, should be filled with an entire beer. Players from each team should alternate around the table. The captains should be opposite each other at the table.

-Gameplay
The captains each start with an empty cup and a ping-pong ball. The captains touch balls and quickly attempt to bounce their ball off of the table and into the empty cup.  
If a shooting player gets his or her ball into the cup on his or her first try, then they can pass their cup with the ball in it to anyone they would like. 
If a shooting player gets his or her ball into the cup on the second, or any following, try, then they can only pass their cup to their immediate left. 
If a shooting player sinks the ball into his or her cup and the person to his or her direct left is still shooting, the shooting player can slap the cup of the still-shooting player off the table and pass his or her cup to the player further to the left.
A player whose cup has been slapped must grab a new beer from the formation, drink it, and attempt to bounce the ball back into the cup. 
The team whose players do not have to drink the last cup is the winning team. 
As always, house rules are always respected. 

**21- Cup**
-Setup
Arrange 21 cups in a triangle on each end of a table. Distribute three beers across each triangle. Designate the three players on each time that will initially throw; the rest of the team serves as keepers. The center player plays rock-paper-scissors to decide which team will start with two balls. 

-Gameplay
At the count of three, players with balls try to throw their ball into a cup on the other end of the table. 
If a ball lands in a cup with beer, the player standing opposite the player that made the ball has to drink the cup. 
As soon as a player gets a ball, he or she may shoot the ball unless he or she has to drink a cup. 
Teams must rearrange the cups on their side as soon as it can be made into a triangle of the sizes 10, 6, 3 and 1. 
If a team breaks either of the previous rules, the opposite team may catch any ball thrown by the offending player or team. 
If a team makes a ball before the other team rearranges the cups, the team does not retroactively get a rearrangement. For example, if team A only has 10 balls left and team B does not rearrange the cups before team A makes another cup, team B does not have to rearrange the nine leftover cups. 
All players that are not shooting serve as keepers whose goal is to get balls back to their team. Keepers must be switched in with every rearrangement that a team gets. 
The team that clears all of the cups from the other side first is the winning team. 
As always, house rules are always respected.

**Mouth**
-Setup
Distribute all players along one end of a table with an empty cup. One beer is distributed across each cup on a team. The beer does not have to be distributed equally. Designate one end of the table as the starting end and the other as the anchor end. Team captains must be the anchors. 

-Gameplay
The starting players touch cups and put their cups on the table.
Starting players must then attempt to drink their cups, without using their hands, as quickly as possible. 
Once a player is finished drinking his or her beer, he or she must flip the cup, again without his or her hands, resulting in the cup being completely face down. 
The next player can only start drinking his or her cup once the cup of the player before him or her has succeeded in flipping the cup. 
Players may use their hands only if their cups fall to the ground. 
The team with the players who finish flipping all of their cups first is the winning team. 
As always, house rules are always respected.
